# Spring-Boot
Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easier to create and run Java applications. It simplifies the configuration and setup process, allowing developers to focus more on writing code for their applications.
## What is Spring Boot?
An open-source Java framework called Spring Boot is used to build microservices. The Pivotal Team created Spring Boot, which offers a quicker and simpler method for configuring and executing web-based and basic applications. It combines embedded servers with the Spring Framework. Spring Boot's primary objective is to shorten the time needed for development, unit testing, and integration testing. Additionally, Spring Boot does not require XML configuration.
## What You Can Do with Spring Boot
Spring Boot allows for the rapid development of apps. It examines your classpath and the beans you've configured, makes educated guesses about what you're missing, and adds those objects. With Spring Boot, you can concentrate on business aspects rather than infrastructure.
## Prerequisite of Spring Boot
1. Java Development Kit
  
2. Build Tool:
   i) Maven,
   ii) Gradle

3. IDE
   
4. Basic Java Knowledge
   
5. Understanding of Web Concept:
   i) HTTP protocol (methods, status codes),
   ii) RESTful APIs,
   iii) Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

6. Dependency Management

## Spring Boot Advantages
It generates standalone Spring applications that are launched with the Java -jar command.

It easily tests web applications using several Embedded HTTP servers like as Tomcat, Jetty, and others. We don't need to distribute WAR files.

It provides 'starter' POMs with strong opinions to help us simplify our Maven settings.

It includes features that are ready for production, such as metrics, health checks, and externalised settings.

There is no need for XML configuration.

It includes a command-line utility for designing and testing Spring Boot applications.

It provides a number of plug-ins.

It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes, XML configuration, and annotations.

It boosts productivity while decreasing development time.
## Limitations of Spring Boot
While Spring Boot is powerful, it has some drawbacks to consider:

It can be tricky to learn at first, especially for beginners.

It may use more memory and take longer to start compared to simpler frameworks.

Its conventions can restrict customization options for specific needs.

Managing multiple microservices can get complicated.

Upgrading or integrating with certain tools may be tricky.

Applications built with Spring Boot can be larger to deploy.
## Conclusion
You've made it through our Spring Boot tutorial, and now you have a solid grasp of essential concepts like dependency injection, Spring Boot starters, and application configuration. With these new skills, you're ready to build and deploy efficient, scalable Java applications. Spring Boot simplifies the development process, whether you're creating microservices, RESTful web services, or enterprise applications. Keep exploring the vast Spring Boot ecosystem, stay active in the developer community, and apply what you've learned to real-world projects.
